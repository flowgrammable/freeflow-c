The Freeflow library contains a number of facilities for
working with Linux system-level abstractions. Note that this
library is continually evolving.

This library includes the following modules:

- format -- A type-safe printf-like formatting library based on cppformat
- cli -- Command line option specification and parser based on cxxopts
- socket -- A low-level, (mostly) type-safe wrapper around POSOIX
- ip -- IPv4 and IPv6 support for the socket library
- ...


The cppformat library can be found here: 


The cxxopts library can be found here:
